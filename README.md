C/N.txt -> number of the line - words with n chars in them - N (the number of files autogenerate)

D.txt -> Char - Number of char coincidences (as you encounter the char)

E.txt -> Char - Number of char coincidences ( sorted DESC by Number of char coincidences)

F.txt -> line number - word - word number of characters (sorted DESC by word number of characters)
